<h3>About Me</h3>
<p> Hi, I'm John, I'm a recent Masters Graduate of Information Science. Currently I'm working as an IT technician but I intend to branch out into my current field of study.

My experience has been diverse, as I have touched upon data, web analytics, as well as writing prior to my current job. During COVID-19 I have helped maintain and add to a data base of food pantry information so that people in need could have access to up to date information. After that, I wanted to intern as technology or IT Support, but was transferred to the technical writing department as the hiring manager deemed by writing skills to be more applicable during their current stage of development. There, I had the chance to exercise my skills in writing under particular guidelines, along with researching technical details. I even had the opportunity of leadership, taking part in guiding writers to adhere to the company's standards, as well as request what type of content goes into our pages. My internship ended and I wanted to lean more into analytics, as I was studying in my class at the time. In Data Ready DFW, we did not have a data or analytics department made yet, as the website was still in development. When the site was developed, we decided to have a data team specifically for monitoring web traffic, as well as search engine optimization. The team leader introduced me to Google Analytics, we learned that this can be paired with Google Tag manager to monitor the web page even down to its individual elements. We mainly wanted to see  how many people were visiting, as well as which elements and pages people were clicking through. We mainly wanted to make our website engaging to reduce our "bounce rate" - the rate at which people bounce off our site without any interaction.

Nowaday's I'm a help desk technician. While I have gone around fixing hardware, I have also assisted in the maintenance and creation of data reports. </p>
