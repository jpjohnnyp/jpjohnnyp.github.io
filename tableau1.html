      <h2>My first Tableau Project</h2>
      <p>My process started at data.oecd.org, where I then looked at the “Technology and Innovations” section. I came across “Gross domestic spending on R&D”, “ICT goods exports”, and “Households with broadband access” to illustrate a country’s advancements in exporting and developing domestic technologies. Originally, each data set was in this type of format: </p>
      <img src="image/vis1.png" class="img-fluid" alt="">
      <p>According to what I learned, I noticed the OECD format of the columns are desired for tableau. After filling each column with my desired variables, I also filled in holes in the data to provide for a complete reading. I then saved this final document of processed data as a worksheet for use.</p>
      <img src="image/vis2.png" class="img-fluid" alt="">
      <p>I noticed that a country’s spending on research and development does not significantly change over time, except by a small increase. However: there is a small positive correlation between R&D, exports, and broadband ownership over time:

      </p>
      <img src="image/vis5.png" class="img-fluid" alt="">
      <p>Looking at broadband connection ownership, R&D had only slight correlation as most of the clustering movement of countries was mostly upward with a steep slope. Korea, the highest point of the cluster shows a steady progression with R&D and broadband connection with a more diagonal movement. </p>
      <p>In sum, with minimal horizontal movement of the increase of investment into R&D, and the seemingly independent higher vertical movement with exports and broadband ownership, there is only a slight correlation. R&D proves to only be a minor factor among others that could contribute to a country’s technological development. </p>

      <h2>DataReady DFW Volunteer</h2>
      <p>October 2020 - Present</p>
      <p>DataReady DFW is a nonprofit organization that aims to educate those in margininalized communities about data literacy. I've been volunteering as a web analyst for their website that they are building.</p>
      <img src="image/analytics.png" alt="" align=center>
      <p>I had to learn Google Analytics to mainly check the bounce rate of a web page. The "bounce rate" refers to the percentage of users that log onto the website but leave without clicking on any other page. The users do nothing and leave, essentially "bouncing" off the page.</p>
