        <h2>Why</h2>
          <p>"An FTP Client is a program designed to transfer files between two computers. While most web browsers support FTP file downloads, to upload files and to perform other FTP tasks a dedicated FTP Client is needed. By using an FTP Client
            <img align = "left" src="file1.jpg" name="img2" width="100" height="100" alt="cherryblossom" onmouseover="document.img2.src = image_2_over.src"
            onmouseout="document.img2.src = image_2.src">
            users can upload, download, delete, rename, move and copy files on a remote server. While FTP could be accessed via terminal, programs with a graphical user interface are preferred, and Filezilla Client represents an easy to use multiplatform solution. Filezilla is the most popular and easy to use FTP Client, it is feature rich and available for Windows, Mac and Linux."


          This means that work can be shared more easily among colleouges. Information Technology workplaces may have work spread throughout long distances. This allows for users to have a means to be updated with latest files despite location. Collaboration can also be achieved, as files may be copied, edited, and sent among groups of people.

        <h2>Assessment</h2>
        <p>"In May 2008, Chris Foresman assessed FTP clients for Ars Technica, saying of FileZilla: "Some friends in the tech support world often recommend the free and open-source FileZilla, which offers a Mac OS X version in addition to Windows and Linux. But I've never been thrilled about its busy interface, which can be daunting for novice users."[10]

Writing for Ars Technica in August 2008 Emil Protalinski said: "this week's free, third-party application recommendation is FileZilla.... This FTP client is very quick and is regularly updated. It may not have a beautiful GUI, but it certainly is fast and has never let me down."[11]

Go Daddy, Clarion University of Pennsylvania and National Capital FreeNet recommend FileZilla for uploading files to their web hosting services.[12][13][14]

FileZilla is available in the repositories of many Linux distributions, including Debian, Ubuntu, Trisquel and Parabola GNU/Linux-libre.[15][16][17][18]

In January 2012, CNET gave FileZilla their highest rating of "spectacular"â€”five out of five stars.[19]

Since the project's participation in SourceForge's program to create revenue by adware, several reviewers started warning about downloading FileZilla and discouraged users from using it.[20][21] " - Wikipedia </p>
        <h2>Pros and Cons of Open Source Software</h2>
        <p>The advantages of open source software is that they are relatively cheaper than closed software made by big companies. Having people constantly modify and tweak the software allows for consistent reliability. Bugs and fixes are immediately handled by the community.</p>
        <p>However, the software itself may have the chance of not lasting long simply due to loss of interests by developers. And while bugs and vulnerabilities may be immediately fixed, the program itself may also become immediately exploited for malicious purposes due to its open-source nature.

        <h2>Pros and Cons of FileZilla</h2>
        <p>Pros: It's free to download. </p>
        <p>Cons: However issues were indicated that there were issues of adware being bundled with it, as well as high vulnerability for malware to read a user's system data.</p>
