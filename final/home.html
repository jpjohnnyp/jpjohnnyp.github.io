                    <h4>Barn Owl</h4>
                    <p>We begin this list with the common barn owl. Also known as Tyto Alba, this species, as the name itself suggests, belongs to the family Tytonidae. It is, by far, the most widely found owl species, and it also holds the reputation of being one of the most widespread bird species in the world. The main characteristic features that distinguishes this owl among other types of owls is its distinct heart-shaped facial disc, along with its long legs, long talons, and small, dark eyes. Also, it has a long wing span, and a short tail that appears somewhat like a square. The bird has a ridge of feathers developed above its bill, resembling a nose. There are 20 – 30 subspecies of this owl. Rodents are the primary source of food for this bird. 9.8 – 18 inches is the bird’s average length, and it has a wingspan of 30 – 43 inches.</p>

                    <h4>Snowy Owl</h4>
                    <p>Next in the list is the snowy owl. Scientifically known as Bubo Scandiacus, it is reputed to be among the largest in the Strigidae family. Also known as the Great White Owl, true to its name, the male bird has a beautiful white plumage, which camouflages it in its Arctic habitat. Females tend to be darker than males. Also, it is known to be the heaviest and one with the second largest wing span in North America. Lemmings are its favorite food, while rabbits, rodents, birds, and fish are also included in the menu at times. 20 – 28 inches is the average body length, and 50. 4 – 57.6 inches, the wingspan.</p>

                    <h4>Elf Owl</h4>
                    <p>As you must have guessed from its name, the elf owl (Micrathene Whitneyi), measures 5 – 5.7 inches in body length, and has a wingspan of 10 cm. It is the world’s lightest owl, and it also belongs to the Strigidae family. The bird has a very round head, with no ear tufts.
