      <h2>A lot to keep track of</h2>
      <img src="image/gopher4.png" alt="">
      <p>We have 1614 Chromebooks to keep track of! We need to keep track of whether it was assinged to a student, who it is assigned to, and how many were issued.</p>
      <img src="image/gopher5.png" class="img-fluid" alt="">
      <p>With every device we assign, on Google Admin we input student info, location, and additional notes for the date of assignemnt, as well as any history of previous devieces.</p>
      <img src="image/gopher1.png" class="img-fluid" alt="">
      <p>Having received a list of serial numbers of the chromebooks, I generated a data report of all these chromebooks. Here, I am able to see data we inputed on Google Admin.
      </p>
      <img src="image/gopher2.png" class="img-fluid" alt="">
      <p>With the list of serial numbers, I wrote a VLOOKUP function in another sheet to find the user associated with each device serial number.</p>
      <img src="image/gopher3.png" class="img-fluid" alt="">
      <p>Any device without the default user, "ptuzzolino@passaic-city.k12.nj.us", is added to a counter that lists the amount of deveices currently assigned and in use, out of the 1614 we have in storage.

      <h2>DataReady DFW Volunteer</h2>
      <p>October 2020 - Present</p>
      <p>DataReady DFW is a nonprofit organization that aims to educate those in margininalized communities about data literacy. I've been volunteering as a web analyst for their website that they are building.</p>
      <img src="image/analytics.png" alt="" align=center>
      <p>I had to learn Google Analytics to mainly check the bounce rate of a web page. The "bounce rate" refers to the percentage of users that log onto the website but leave without clicking on any other page. The users do nothing and leave, essentially "bouncing" off the page.</p>
