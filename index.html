    <p>To who ever is reading this, Welcome! I'm still very new to the design/development field, but I've recently appreciated the capabilities of web design. I graduated Rutgers University with a Major in Information Science and a Minor in Visual Arts. What stuck with me was learning about web design, prototyping, and communicating visually. As of now I am studying Data Science for a Masters in Information science from the same school. But Again I am still drawn to the visual/design side of things. It was when I took a class in Information Visualization that I learned that data and visual design can be combined into something practical but also appealing.
    </p>
    <p>As you can see, I have the basics of HTML and CSS down, with Bootstrap too. I am still learning to implement what I learned from my classes for personal projects. So far, you can see what I learned below. I have seen how creative people can be with their websites, not just for practicality, but also expression. And I intend to keep learning to better realize my imagination.</p>

    <p>While I'm not schooling or working, I've recently taken up art and drawing again. I've always wanted to be good at art.</p>

      <h2>Information Visualization</h2>
      <p>As my class came to a close, we had a final project that required the use of tableau to create a datastory on a topic of our choosing. I chose to research our use of energy resources - How we are using renewable and non-renewable resources, and what possible solutions we can have for non-renewable resources. Below are key takeaways from my research:</p>

    <h2>Database Design and Management, final project</h2>
    <img src="image/datafinal.png" width=60% align=left alt="">
    <p>Our final project is to make a small database using MySQL and PHP to integrate with a website. My database consists of a list of clothing products, who bought them, and which clothes are selling the most. The objective of the database is to be a means of determining what clothing should be recommended by a website by order of preferences and sales. </p>

  <p>DataReady DFW is a nonprofit organization that aims to educate those in margininalized communities about data literacy. I've been volunteering as a web analyst for their website that they are building.</p>

  <p>I had to learn Google Analytics to mainly check the bounce rate of a web page. The "bounce rate" refers to the percentage of users that log onto the website but leave without clicking on any other page. The users do nothing and leave, essentially "bouncing" off the page.</p>
